# Learning

## Learning Python From Scratch
Python is (_as [Wikipedia says][wikipython]_), a *general-purpose and high-level programming language*.
 It can be used to write a wide variety of different kinds of software, from video games to HTTP servers to command-line tools - and a whole lot else.
 It is especially good at 'gluing' different systems and programs together.


And we think the best way to learn is to _play_ and to _practice_ with coding projects big and small - or with small problems like the ones here on exercism!
