# Tests

We use [pytest][Getting Started Guide] as our website test runner.
You will need to install `pytest` on your development machine if you want to download and run exercise tests for the Python track locally.
You should also install the following `pytest` plugins:

- [pytest-cache][pytest-cache]
- [pytest-subtests][pytest-subtests]

We also recommend using the code linting program [pylint][pylint], as it is part of our automated feedback on the website and can be a very useful static code analysis tool.
For ease-of-use, the [pytest-pylint][pytest-pylint] plugin for `pytest` will allow you to run `pylint` via `pytest` on the command line.

Pylint configuration can be a bit much, so this [tutorial from pylint.readthedocs.io][tutorial from pylint.readthedocs.io] can be helpful for getting started, as can this overview of [Code Quality: Tools and Best Practices][Code Quality: Tools and Best Practices] from Real Python.

## Installing pytest

Pytest can be installed and updated using the built-in Python utility [`pip`][pip].

For additional tips, Brett Cannon has a nice [quick-and-dirty guide on how to install packages for python][quick-and-dirty], along with a great explanation on [why you should use `python -m pip`][python-m-pip].
For more on Python's command line arguments, see [command line and environment][python command line] in the Python documentation.

**Note:** `Python3` and `py` may or may not be aliases for Python on your system.
Please adjust the install commands below accordingly.
To install `pytest` in a virtual environment, ensure the environment **is activated** prior to executing commands.
Otherwise, the `pytest` installation will be global.

#### Windows

```powershell
PS C:\Users\foobar> py -m pip install pytest pytest-cache pytest-subtests pytest-pylint
Successfully installed pytest-8.3.3 ...
```

#### Linux / MacOS

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install pytest pytest-cache pytest-subtests pytest-pylint
Successfully installed pytest-8.3.3 ...

```

To check if installation was successful:

```bash
$ python3 -m pytest --version
pytest 8.3.3
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, go to the folder where the exercise is stored using `cd` in your terminal (_replace `<exercise-folder-location>` below with your path_).

```bash
$ cd <exercise-folder-location>
```

<br>

~~~~exercism/note
 `<exercise-folder-location>` or most things inside angle brackets denote a **_placeholder value_**.
A normal path or file name should be written _without_ any brackets.  


For example: `/Users/janedoe/exercism/python/exercises/concept/chaitanas-colossal-coaster` (on *nix systems), `C:\Users\janedoe\exercism\python\exercises\practice\hello-world\` (on Windows), `myFolder` or `my_file.py`.
~~~~  

<br>


The file you will want to run usually ends in `_test.py`.
This file contains the tests for the exercise solution, and are the same tests that run on the website when a solution is uploaded.
Next, run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<exercise_test.py>` with the location/name of the test file:

```bash
$ python3 -m pytest -o markers=task <exercise_test.py>
==================== 7 passed in 0.08s ====================
```

### Fixing warnings

If you do not use the `pytest -o markers=task` in the command above, is possible that you will get `warnings` about "unknown markers" when running a test that uses our _new_ syntax.

To avoid typing `pytest -o markers=task` for every test you run, you can use a `pytest.ini` configuration file, which can be downloaded from the top level of the Python track directory: [pytest.ini][pytest.ini].

You can also create your own `pytest.ini` file with the following content:

```ini
[pytest]
markers =
    task: A concept exercise task.
```

Placing this file in the _root_ or _working_ directory for Exercism exercises will register the marks and stop the warnings.
More information on pytest marks can be found in the `pytest` documentation on [marking test functions][marking test functions with attributes] and the `pytest` documentation on [working with custom markers][working with custom markers].

_More information on customizing pytest configurations can be found in the pytest documentation on [configuration file formats][configuration file formats]_

### Test Failures

When tests fail, `pytest` prints the text of each failed test, along with the expected and actual `return` values of each to the terminal.
Below is an generic example of a failed test:

```bash
$(my_venv) python3 -m pytest -o markers=task <exercise_test.py>

=================== FAILURES ====================
______________ name_of_failed_test ______________
# Test code inside of <exercise_test.py> that failed.
...
E   TypeOfError: ReturnedValue != ExpectedValue

exercise_test.py:<line_of_failed_test>: TypeOfError
============ short test summary info ============
FAILED exercise_test.py::ExerciseTest::name_of_failed_test
========== 1 failed, 2 passed in 0.13s ==========
```

### Extra arguments

If you really want to be specific about what pytest returns on your screen, here are some handy command-line arguments that allows you to configure its behavior.

#### Return All Details [`-v`]

Adding the `-v` (_verbose_) flag will return both environment information and a test summary in addition to test failures:

```bash
$(my_venv)  python3 -m pytest -o markers=task -v exercises/<exercise_name>/<test_file_test.py>

================================================ FAILURES ======================================================
# Failed tests are then individually printed out below

.......
```

#### Stop After First Failure [`-x`]

Using the `-x` flag will run the tests as normal, but stop the test run upon the first test failure.
This helps when you want to debug a single task or test failure at a time:

```bash
$(my_venv) python3 -m pytest -o markers=task -x exercises/<exercise_name>/<test_file_test.py>

=================== FAILURES ====================
_______________ example_test_foo ________________
...
...
============ short test summary info ============
FAILED example_test.py::ExampleTest::example_test_foo
!!!!!!!!!!! stopping after 1 failures !!!!!!!!!!!
========== 1 failed, 5 passed in 0.28s ==========
```

#### Failed Tests First [`--ff`]

The `pytest-cache` plugin remembers which tests failed last time you ran `pytest`, so using the flag `--ff` will tell `pytest` to run previously failed tests **first**, then continue with the remainder of the tests.
This might speed up your testing if you are making a lot of smaller fixes around one particular task or set of inputs.

```bash
$(my_venv) python3 -m pytest -o markers=task --ff <example_file_test.py>
==================== 7 passed in 503s ====================
```

### Recommended Workflow

We recommend using the following commands to make your debugging easier and (possibly) faster:

First change your working directory to the directory of the exercise you want to test:

```bash
$(my_venv) cd path/to/exercise
```

Then, run the tests together with the previously explained arguments `-x` and`--ff`:

```bash
$(my_venv) python3 -m pytest -o markers=task -x --ff <example_file_test.py>
```

This will test your solution.
When `pytest` encounters a failed test, the program will stop and tell you which test failed.
When you make fixes and run the test again, `pytest` will first run the previous test that failed, then continue with the remaining tests.

### Using PDB, the Python Debugger, with pytest

If you want to "debug like a pro", you can use the `--pdb` argument after the `pytest` command, and drop into the built-in [Python debugger][pdb], `PDB`.

```bash
$(my_venv) python3 -m pytest -o markers=task -x --ff --pdb <example_file_test.py>
=============== 4 passed in 0.15s ===============
```

When a test fails, dropping into `PDB` will allow you to step through your code viewing the current scope, as well as checking the value of variables and the signature of different functions.
More details on the `PDB` module can be found in the [Python documentation on PDB][pdb].
Additionally, the [pytest docs on PDB][pytest-pdb] and [this guide from Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/) are extremely helpful.

We explore multiple IDEs, editors and some useful extensions for linting and debugging there.

## Additional information

### Adding python to your PATH

**Note:** If you have installed Python on Windows via the [PSF Installer][psf-installer], then the command will be `py` as opposed to `python3`.

Typing `python3 -m` every time you want to run a module can get a little annoying.
To avoid this, you can add the `Scripts` folder of your Python installation to your path.
If you do not know where you have installed Python, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ python3 -c "import os, sys; print(os.path.dirname(sys.executable))"
<python_directory>
```

The _returned_ directory is where your current active Python version is installed, in this section it is referred to as `<python_directory>`.

#### Windows

Click the `Windows Start` button and lookup _Edit the system environment variables_ and press enter.
Next press, `Environment Variables...`:

![Press the blue button, lol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/python/main/docs/img/Windows-SystemProperties.png)

Then find the `Path` variable in your _User variables_, select it, and click `Edit...`:

![Selecting the path variable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/python/main/docs/img/Windows-EnvironmentVariables.png)

Then add a new line, as shown in the picture, replacing `<python_directory>` with your Python installation's directory:

![Add python to path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/python/main/docs/img/Windows-AddPythonPath.png)

#### MacOS/Linux

The below should work for most Linux and MacOS flavors with a `bash` shell.
Commands may vary by Linux distro, and whether a `fish` or `zsh` shell is used.
Replace `<python_directory>` with the output of `python3 -c "import os, sys; print(os.path.dirname(sys.executable))"`

```bash
export PATH=”$PATH:<python_directory>”
```
