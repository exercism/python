# Tools

A list of tools, IDEs and editors that can help you write and debug your *Python* code.

*Disclaimer: This is a collection of tools that are popular in our community. We do not have any financial affiliation with any of the tools listed below. We think these tools do their job and there are most certainly other tools that can do those jobs as well.*

Before you can start coding, make sure that you have the proper version of python installed. Exercism currently supports `Python 3.8` and above. For more information, please refer to [Installing Python locally](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/python/installation).

## Environments

Python environments are like separate Python installations, they can cleanup your workflow and projects by separating the packages you install. Making sure that you don't get bugs generated by something that you imported in another project.

There are two major *virtual environments* in use today, `virtualenv` and `conda`. Both of which are generally easy to install.

### Venv

Also known as `virtualenv`, *venv* is a light-weight solution to virtual environments. It creates a separate Python binary for every virtual environment and stores that inside your directory.

#### Creating your virtual environment

To create a virtual environment, `cd` to the directory you want to put the *venv* in. Then run the `virtualenv` command with the name folder which will store your *environment*, common convention is to call it `venv`:

```bash
$ python3 -m virtualenv {name_of_virtualenv}
created virtual environment ... in 8568ms
```

#### Activating your virtual environment

To activate the virtual environment on Windows, run the following command:

```powershell
PS> .\{name_of_virtual_env}\Scripts\activate
(venv) PS> _
```

To activate your virtual environment on Linux, or MacOS X, run the following command:

```bash
$ source {name_of_virtual_env}/bin/activate
(venv) $ _
```

From this terminal you can now run `pip` commands. All of the packages installed in the environment will go to `{name_of_virtual_env}/Lib`.

#### Virtual Environment wrapper

Reference: [Wiki](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The `virtualenvwrapper` module manages all your virtual environments in one place. You can create, copy, delete and switch between environments using the tools the module provides. It also allows for extensions so you can add tools you'd like. You can create your own extension using the tutorial found [here](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#plugins).

### Conda

*Latest download can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)*

Packaged with *Anaconda*, `conda` environments are similar to [venv environments](#venv) with the key difference being that `conda` can support the `R programming language`. Anaconda is most commonly used by researchers and data scientists, because of its set of tools and programs tailored to them. The [Spyder IDE](#spider-ide) is one of the tools that comes with Anaconda.

To create a new `conda` environment, go to the *Anaconda Navigator*. Click on `environments` and then press the `Create` button. Fill in a name for your `conda` environment, select Python `3.8 or above` and click `Create`:

#### Activating your conda environment

Activating your `conda` environment is easy, just click the `►` button next to your *environment*, then press `Open Terminal`. This should open a new terminal with an interface for your `conda` environment.

From here you can run regular `pip` commands and other modules that you have installed inside your environment. All libraries will automatically be installed inside the `conda` environment.

## Editors and IDEs

### Visual Studio Code

Visual studio code (VS Code) is a code editor created by Microsoft. It is not specialized to work for a specific programming language, but to be an editor that can do everything. You can extend the editor using extensions, but it comes with some great extensions as well.

#### Python for VS Code

Extension: _Extension-id: ms-python.python_

![Python Extension Header on VS Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/python/main/docs/img/VSCode-EXT-Python-Header.png)

The Python extension from Microsoft is extremely useful because of its range of features. Notably it supports testing and has a testing explorer! It has many other features that you can view on [its homepage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

##### Selecting the interpreter

The Python extensions supports the switching between multiple `interpreters`, this way you can use different Python environments for different projects. This is also useful for when you are using `venv` or `conda`, which you find more about [here](#environments).

Click on the "Select interpreter" button in the lower left-hand of your window, another window should pop up where you can select the interpreter you want to use.

![Interpreter selection PT2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/python/main/docs/img/VSCode-EXT-Python-SelectInterpreter-2.png)

##### Other features

The Python plugin also comes with some other features that can help you debug and improve your python code, here are some of those tools.

[Test discovery tool](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_configure-tests) - A tool that generates a tree containing all the *Pytest* and *Unittest* inside a directory. It will give you an easier and more readable interface for *Pytest*.

[Debugging tool](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_configure-tests) - This tool will help you debug your code, it allows you to set a `breakpoint` on a line. The debugging tool then allows you to view all *private* and *global* variables at that point in your program.

[Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_configure-tests) - Linting looks out for simple mistakes in your code and notifies you when you write bad-practice code according to PEP. Exercism currently focusses on the correct use of [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

[Formatting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting) - This tool automatically formats your code to look a certain way, we recommend `autopep8` because it adheres to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), other formatters are supported.

[Config reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference) - If you want to make your Python development on VS Code behave exactly like you want it to, view this reference guide. It explains options for the extension that can really improve your coding experience.

### PyCharm

PyCharm is an *Integrated Development Environment* built by JetBrains. It is specialized to work for Python and is commonly used among professionals. You can also extend it's features using plugins, but out-of-the-box it comes with a load of features pre-installed.

#### Selecting the interpreter

Open your project, then navigate to `File` >> `Settings` >> `Project: ...` >> `Python Interpreter`. Click on the dropdown menu and select the environment you will be using. If the environment you would like to use is not in the list click on the `Show All...` button:

![Interpreter Selection Dropdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/python/main/docs/img/PyCharm-Config-InterpreterDropDown.png)

From there click on the `+` button to add a new interpreter. Select the type of interpreter on the left, we suggest you either run a [conda]() or [virtualenv]() environment, but running the *system interpreter* works fine too. Once you selected your interpreter, press the `Okay` button.

![Add New Interpreter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/python/main/docs/img/PyCharm-Config-InterpreterNew.png)

#### Other features

Some other features that we won't cover in this guide, but are really useful for development are:

[Running Tests](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/pytest.html#run-pytest-test) - Running tests directly from a GUI in your window is really easy, but don't forget to look at the [pytest parameters](TESTS.md#extra-arguments) to set it up to your liking.

[Debug Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-code.html) - Debugging in PyCharm can get really extensive, but can be really useful as well. Start here to learn how to properly debug using PyCharm.

### Spyder IDE

Spyder is a python IDE tailored for the scientific community. It packs some really good debugging utilities and it has an integrated *IPython terminal*. Out-of-the-box it does not come with support for *Unittests* and *Pytests*, but there is an official plugin available.

#### Selecting the interpreter

To change the interpreter, go to `tools` >> `Preferences` >> `Python interpreter`. You can either select the global interpreter defined by Spyder or you can enter the path to your own Python environment.

![Spyder Python Interpreter Selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/python/main/docs/img/Spyder-Config-Interpreter.png)

Do not forget to click `Apply` once you selected your interpreter.

#### Other features

[Spyder Unittest](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-unittest/releases/latest) - If you want to have a built-in interface for you tests, install this plugin. Clicking the link will bring you to the latest release on GitHub.

[Code analyzer](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/pylint.html#using-the-code-analyzer) - An integrated tool for analyzing your code, detecting bad practices, and catching bugs before you run your program. You can also configure it to only catch [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) violations.

[Debugging](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/debugging.html) - This tool will help you debug your code, it allows you to set a `breakpoint` on a line. The debugging tool will then let you go through your python code and quickly notice where it goes wrong.

[Variable Explorer](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/variableexplorer.html) - This tool is really useful in combination with the debugger. It allows you to view all the active variables in your code and it even allows editing of the values inside those variables.

### Sublime text

A text editor for coding, made by *Sublime HQ Pty Ltd*. It is similar to [VS Code](#visual-studio-code) in a lot of regards. Sublime text is almost fully customizable. It also has a built-in auto-complete engine and comes with Python syntax highlighting out-of-the-box.

#### Notable extensions

Sublime Text comes with a lot of tools already, but some of these tools could make your python development easier. Make sure you have *package control* installed, go to `Tools` >> `Install Package Control...`. To install packages open your command pallet and type in `Package Control: Install Package`, here you can enter the name of the packages you'd like to install.

[Terminus](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminus) - A terminal for your sublime. It is fully featured and support for Windows operating systems. This package is almost a must-have for you to be able to run `pytest` scripts.

[SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter) - A linter for sublime. This tool notifies you about python code that does not follow best practices. We recommend you set it up to use PEP-8.

### JupyterLab

Jupyter lab is an in-browser code editor that runs on your machine. You can install it using a `pip` command in your *environment* and Jupyter will use that environment. Jupyter is most well-known for its code "notebooks". It is commonly used among data-scientists.

#### Notable extensions

The built-in tools for Jupyter Lab are good-enough for almost all exercises on *Exercism*. Most extensions made for Jupyter are made with data-science in mind. Explore extensions at your own pleasure.
