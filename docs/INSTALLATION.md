If Python isn't already available on your system follow the instructions at [the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/#getting-started) to install Python on your computer.

Exercism currently supports Python3.4, Python3.3 and Python2.7.

## Packages

The [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) contains thousands of packages.
Pretty much each of them is installable with `pip install packagename`.
If you don't have __pip__ already, [get it now](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)!

##  Tests

We recommend you install [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) and [pytest-cache](http://pythonhosted.org/pytest-cache/). Pytest is a testing tool that will give you more flexibility over running your unit tests.

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install pytest pytest-cache
```
