# `range`

The `range()` built-in represents an immutable sequence of numbers (or any object that implements the **index** dunder method). Used in the [markdown][markdown] to control the number of loops while iterating through a passed-in line or list. Used in [robot-simulator][robot-simulator] to represent the values from zero to 3 as assigned to NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST.

See the Python documentation entries for the [immutable][immutable] [`range` type][docs-range-type] and its [constructor][range-as-function]. This is Python's most commonly used tool for efficiently working with a [sequential collection][docs-sequence-types] of [`int`][int] values.
