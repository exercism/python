# Decorators

TODO: ADD MORE

- a higher-order function that takes another function as an argument. The "decorating" function extends the behavior of the "decorated" function without explicitly modifying it (i.e. it _wraps_ or _decorates_ it). Called in python by using the `@` symbol and the function name ahead of the function being decorated. The example uses pythons built-in `property()` as a decorator (`@property`) to return a "compound" read-only instance property made up of two separate instance attributes.
