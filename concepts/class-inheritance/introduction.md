# Introduction

[Inheritance](inherit) represents what is known as a relationship. When a Derived class inherits from a Base class, you've established a relationship in which Derived is a specialised version of Base.
Either by using single or multiple inheritance, we can inherit the properties from the base class. Inheritance is used because it helps in code reusability.
