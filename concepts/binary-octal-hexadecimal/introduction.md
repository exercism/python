# binary, octal, hexadecimal

Binary, octal, and hexadecimal (_also known as hex_) are different [numeral systems][numeral-systems] with different bases.
Binary is base 2, octal is base 8, and hexadecimal is base 16.
Normal integers are base 10 in python.
Binary, octal, and hexadecimal literals are all considered `int` subtypes and Python automatically converts between them.
This means that they can only represent zero, positive, and negative numbers that do not have a fractional or decimal part.
Binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers support all integer operations.
However, division (_as with ints_) will return a `float`.
