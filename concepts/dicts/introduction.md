# Introduction

A dictionary (`dict`) in Python is a data structure that associates [hashable][term-hashable] _keys_ to _values_ and is known in other programming languages as a resizable [hash table][hashtable-wikipedia], hashmap, or [associative array][associative-array].
Dictionaries are Python's only built-in [mapping type][mapping-types-dict].


`Keys` must be hashable and unique across the dictionary.
Key types can include `numbers`, `str`, or `tuples` (of _immutable_ values).
They cannot contain _mutable_ data structures such as `lists`, `dict`s, or `set`s.
As of Python 3.7, `dict` key order is guaranteed to be the order in which entries are inserted.

`values` can be of any data type or structure.
 Values can also nest _arbitrarily_, so they can include lists-of-lists, sub-dictionaries, and other custom or compound data structures.

Given a `key`, dictionaries can retrieve a `value` in (on average) constant time (_independent of the number of entries_).
Compared to searching for a value within a `list` or `array` (_without knowing the `index` position_), a `dict` uses significantly more memory, but has very rapid retrieval.
Dictionaries are especially useful in scenarios where the collection of items is large and must be accessed and updated frequently.
