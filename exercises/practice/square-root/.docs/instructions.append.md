## How this Exercise is Structured in Python


Python offers a wealth of mathematical functions in the form of the [math module][math-module] and built-ins such as the exponentiation operator `**`, [`pow()`][pow] and [`sum()`][sum].
However, we'd like you to consider the challenge of solving this exercise without those built-ins or modules.

While there is a mathematical formula that will find the square root of _any_ number, we have gone the route of having only [natural numbers][nautral-number] (positive integers) as solutions.  
It is possible to compute the square root of any natural number using only natural numbers in the computation.
