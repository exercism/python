# Hints

## General

Have you tried to break your logic up into one or more helper functions?
This type of song is known as a [cumulative song][cumulative song], so it could be particularly well suited to being "broken up".
Doing so may make your code easier to reason about and will conform to the [Single Responsibility Principle][Single Responsibility Principle].

## Approaches
