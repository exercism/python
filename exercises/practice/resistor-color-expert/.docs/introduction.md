# Introduction

If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.
Like the previous [`Resistor Color Duo`][resistor-color-duo-exercise] and [`Resistor Color Trio`][resistor-color-trio-exercise] exercises, you will be translating resistor color bands to human-readable labels.

- Each resistor has a resistance value.
- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.
  To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.
- Each band acts as a digit of a number.
  For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.
