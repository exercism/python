# Instructions

Convert a number, represented as a sequence of digits in one base, to any other base.

Implement general base conversion.
Given a number in base **a**, represented as a sequence of digits, convert it to base **b**.

## Note

- Try to implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.

## About [Positional Notation][positional-notation]

In positional notation, a number in base **b** can be understood as a linear combination of powers of **b**.

The number 42, _in base 10_, means:

`(4 * 10^1) + (2 * 10^0)`

The number 101010, _in base 2_, means:

`(1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0)`

The number 1120, _in base 3_, means:

`(1 * 3^3) + (1 * 3^2) + (2 * 3^1) + (0 * 3^0)`

I think you got the idea!

_Yes. Those three numbers above are exactly the same. Congratulations!_
