# Introduction

A shipment of emergency supplies has arrived, but there's a problem.
To protect from damage, the items — flashlights, first-aid kits, blankets — are packed inside boxes, and some of those boxes are nested several layers deep inside other boxes!

To be prepared for an emergency, everything must be easily accessible in one box.
Can you unpack all the supplies and place them into a single box, so they're ready when needed most?
