# `filter` for multiples

```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, factors):
    return sum(filter(
        lambda n: any(n % f == 0 for f in factors if f != 0),
        range(limit)
    ))
```

Probably the most straightforward way of solving this problem is to

1. look at every individual integer between `0` and `limit`,
2. check that it is a multiple of any of the given `factors`, and
3. add it to the sum when it is.


## Notable language features used in this solution

### Built-in function: `sum`

Adding all the numbers in a collection together is a very common operation.
Therefore, Python provides the built-in function [`sum`][builtin-sum].

`sum` takes one argument, and requires that it be **iterable**.
A value is iterable whenever it makes sense to use it in a `for` loop like this:

```python
for element in iterable_value:  # üëà
    ...
```

The `list` is the most commonly used iterable data structure.
Many other containers are also iterable, such as `set`s, `tuple`s, `range`s, and even `dict`s and `str`ings.
Still other examples include iterators and generators, which are discussed below.

When given a collection of numbers, `sum` will look at the elements one by one and add them up.
The result is a single number.

```python
numbers = range(1, 100 + 1)  # 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, 100
sum(numbers)  # ‚üπ 5050
```

Had the highlighted solution not used `sum`, it might have looked like this:

```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, factors):
    multiples = filter(
        lambda n: any(n % f == 0 for f in factors if f != 0),
        range(limit))
    total = 0
    for multiple in multiples:
        total += multiple
    return total
```


### Built-in function: `filter`

Selecting elements of a collection for having a certain property is also a very common operation.
Therefore, Python provides the built-in function [`filter`][builtin-filter].

`filter` takes two arguments.
The first is a **predicate**.
The second is the iterable the elements of which should be filtered.

A predicate is a function that takes one argument (of any particular type) and returns a `bool`.
Such functions are commonly used to encode properties of values.
An example is `str.isupper`, which takes a `str` and returns `True` whenever it is uppercase:

```python
str.isupper("AAAAH! üò±")  # ‚üπ True
str.isupper("Eh? üòï")     # ‚üπ False
str.isupper("‚¨ÜÔ∏èüíº")       # ‚üπ False
```

Thus, the function `str.isupper` represents the property of _being an uppercase string_.

Contrary to what you might expect, `filter` does not return a data structure like the one given as the iterable argument:

```python
filter(str.isupper, ["THUNDERBOLTS", "and", "LIGHTNING"])
# ‚üπ <filter object at 0x000002F46B107BE0>
```

Instead, it returns an **iterator**.

An iterator is an object whose sole purpose is to guide iteration through some data structure.
In particular, `filter` makes sure that elements that do not satisfy the predicate are skipped:

```python
for word in filter(str.isupper, ["THUNDERBOLTS", "and", "LIGHTNING"]):
    print(word)
# prints:
# THUNDERBOLTS
# LIGHTNING
```

An iterator is a bit like a cursor that can move only to the right.

The main differences between containers (such as `list`s) and iterators are

- Containers can, depending on their contents, take up a lot of space in memory, but iterators are typically very small regardless of how many elements they 'contain'.
- Containers can be iterated over multiple times, but iterators can be used only once.

To illustrate the latter difference:

```python
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

numbers = range(20)                      # 0, 1, ‚Ä¶, 19
even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)  # 0, 2, ‚Ä¶, 18
sum(numbers)       # ‚üπ 190
sum(numbers)       # ‚üπ 190
sum(even_numbers)  # ‚üπ 90
sum(even_numbers)  # ‚üπ 0
```

Here, `sum` iterates over both `numbers` and `even_numbers` twice.

In the case of `numbers` everything is fine.
Even after looping through the whole of `numbers`, all its elements are still there, and so `sum` can ask to see them again without problem.

The situation with `even_numbers` is less simple.
To use the _cursor_ analogy: after going through all of `even_number`'s 'elements' &ndash; actually elements of `numbers` &ndash; the cursor has moved all the way to the right.
It cannot move backwards, so if you wish to iterate over all even numbers again then you need a new cursor.
We say that the `even_numbers` iterator is _exhausted_. When `sum` asks for its elements again, `even_numbers` comes up empty and so `sum` returns `0`.

Had the highlighted solution not used `filter`, it might have looked like this:

```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, factors):
    def is_multiple(n):
        return any(n % f == 0 for f in factors if f != 0)

    multiples = [candidate for candidate in range(limit) if is_multiple(candidate)]
    return sum(multiples)
```

This variant stores all the multiples in a `list` before summing them.
Such a list can become very big.
For example, if `limit = 1_000_000_000` and `factors = [1]` then `multiples` will take up 8 gigabytes of memory!
It is to avoid unnecessarily creating such large intermediate data structures that iterators are often used.


### A function expression: `lambda`

Typically, when using higher-order functions like `filter` and `map`, the function to pass as an argument does not yet exist and needs to be defined first.

The standard way of defining functions is through the `def` statement:

```python
def name(parameters):
    statements
```

Downsides of this construct include

- the syntax can be a bit bulky
- it requires coming up with a fresh name

These qualities can be quite bothersome when you just need a simple function of no particular significance for single use only.
In situations like this you might like to use a **lambda expression** instead.

A lambda expression is a specific kind of expression that evaluates to a function.
It looks like this:

```python
lambda parameters: expression  # general form
lambda a, b, x: a * x + b      # specific example
```

This latter lambda expression evaluates to a function that takes three arguments (`a`, `b`, `x`) and returns the value `a * x + b`.
Except for not having a name, it is equivalent to the function defined by

```python
def some_name(a, b, x):
    return a * x + b
```

A lambda expression need not necessarily be passed as an argument.
It can also be applied to arguments immediately, or assigned to a variable:

```python
lambda a, b, x: a * x + b
# ‚üπ <function <lambda> at 0x000001F36A274CC0>

(lambda a, b, x: a * x + b)(2, 3, 5)
# ‚üπ 13

some_function = lambda a, b, x: a * x + b
some_function(2, 3, 5)
# ‚üπ 13

list(filter(
    lambda s: len(s) <= 3, 
    ["aaaa", "b", "ccccc", "dd", "eee"]
))
# ‚üπ ['b', 'dd', 'eee']
```

~~~~exercism/note
Immediately applying a lambda expression is possible, but generally pointless:

```python
# Instead of
(lambda a, b, x: a * x + b)(2, 3, y)
# you might as well write
2 * y + 3
```
~~~~

~~~~exercism/caution
Assigning a lambda expressions to variables is unidiomatic.
When you want to give a lambda expression a name, use `def` instead.
~~~~

Only functions that can be defined using a single (`return`) statement can be written as a lambda expression.
If you need multiple statements, you have no choice but to use `def`.

Had the highlighted solution not used `lambda`, it might have looked like this:

```python
def sum_of_multiples(limit, factors):
    def is_multiple(n): 
        return any(n % f == 0 for f in factors if f != 0)

    return sum(filter(is_multiple, range(limit)))
```


### Built-in function: `any`

...


### A generator expression

## Reflections on this approach

An important advantage of this approach is that it is very easy to understand.
However, it suffers from potentially performing a lot of unnecessary work, for example when all `factors` are large, or when there are no `factors` at all.
