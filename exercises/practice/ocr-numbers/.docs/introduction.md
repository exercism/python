# Introduction

Your best friend Marta recently landed their dream job working with a local history museum's collections.
Knowing of your interests in programming, they confide in you about an issue at work for an upcoming exhibit on computing history.
A local university's math department had donated several boxes of historical printouts, but given the poor condition of the documents, the decision has been made to digitize the text.
However, the university's old printer had some quirks in how text was represented, and your friend could use your help to extract the data successfully.
