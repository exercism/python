# Dominoes

Make a chain of dominoes.

Compute a way to order a given set of dominoes in such a way that they form a
correct domino chain (the dots on one half of a stone match the dots on the
neighbouring half of an adjacent stone) and that dots on the halfs of the stones
which don't have a neighbour (the first and last stone) match each other.

For example given the stones `21`, `23` and `13` you should compute something
like `12 23 31` or `32 21 13` or `13 32 21` etc, where the first and last numbers are the same.

For stones 12, 41 and 23 the resulting chain is not valid: 41 12 23's first and last numbers are not the same. 4 != 3

Some test cases may use duplicate stones in a chain solution, assume that multiple Domino sets are being used.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.


For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
