# Linked List

Implement a doubly linked list.

Like an array, a linked list is a simple linear data structure. Several 
common data types can be implemented using linked lists, like queues, 
stacks, and associative arrays.

A linked list is a collection of data elements called *nodes*. In a 
*singly linked list* each node holds a value and a link to the next node. 
In a *doubly linked list* each node also holds a link to the previous 
node.

You will write an implementation of a doubly linked list. Implement a 
Node to hold a value and pointers to the next and previous nodes. Then 
implement a List which holds references to the first and last node and 
offers an array-like interface for adding and removing items:

* `push` (*insert value at back*);
* `pop` (*remove value at back*);
* `shift` (*remove value at front*).
* `unshift` (*insert value at front*);

To keep your implementation simple, the tests will not cover error 
conditions. Specifically: `pop` or `shift` will never be called on an 
empty list.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.


For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).
