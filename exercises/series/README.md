# Series

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in
that string.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- 491
- 914
- 142

And the following 4-digit series:

- 4914
- 9142

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions*
in the input; the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).
