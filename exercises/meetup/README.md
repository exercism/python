# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.  In this exercise, you will take
a description of a meetup date, and return the actual meetup date.

Examples of general descriptions are:

- the first Monday of January 2017
- the third Tuesday of January 2017
- the Wednesteenth of January 2017
- the last Thursday of January 2017

Note that "Monteenth", "Tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There
was a meetup whose members realized that there are exactly 7 numbered days in a month that
end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'
in every month.

Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and descriptor
(first, second, teenth, etc), calculate the date of the actual meetup.
For example, if given "First Monday of January 2017", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/2

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).
