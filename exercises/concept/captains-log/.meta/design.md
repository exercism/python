# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the basics of `random` functions in Python.

## Learning objectives

- Understand the use of `choice()` to select randomly from a sequence
- Understand the use of `randint()` to generate integers in a desired range
- Understand the use of `uniform()` to generate uniformly-distributed `float`s in a desired range

## Out of scope

- Non-uniform statistical distributions such as `gaussian()`
- Security-focussed functionality in `secrets`

## Concepts covered

- `datetime.date`
- `strptime()`
- `strftime()`

## Prerequisites

- `string-formatting`
- `lists`

## Implementing

The general Python track concept exercise implantation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/languages/python/reference/implementing-a-concept-exercise.md).

Tests should be written using `unittest.TestCase` and the test file named `$SLUG_test.py`.

Code in the `.meta/example.py` file should **only use syntax & concepts introduced in this exercise or one of its prerequisites.**
