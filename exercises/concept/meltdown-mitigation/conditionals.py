    A reactor is said to be critical if it satisfies the following conditions:
    - The temperature is less than 800 K.
    - The number of neutrons emitted per second is greater than 500.
    - The product of temperature and neutrons emitted per second is less than 500000.

    3. red -> efficiency below 60%, but still 30% or more,
    4. black ->  less than 30% efficient.
