def is_criticality_balanced(temperature, neutrons_emitted):
    """Verify criticality is balanced.

    Parameters:
        temperature (int or float): The temperature value in kelvin.
        neutrons_emitted (int or float): The number of neutrons emitted per second.

    Returns:
        bool: Is criticality balanced?

    Note:
        A reactor is said to be balanced in criticality if it satisfies the following conditions:
            - The temperature is less than 800 K.
            - The number of neutrons emitted per second is greater than 500.
            - The product of temperature and neutrons emitted per second is less than 500000.

    Parameters:
        voltage (int or float): Voltage value.
        current (int or float): Current value.
        theoretical_max_power (int or float): The power level that corresponds to a 100% efficiency.

        str: One of ('green', 'orange', 'red', or 'black').

    Note:
        Efficiency can be grouped into 4 bands:

            2. orange -> efficiency of less than 80% but at least 60%,
            3. red -> efficiency below 60%, but still 30% or more,
            4. black ->  less than 30% efficient.

        The percentage value is calculated as
        (generated power/ theoretical max power)*100
