    A reactor is said to be critical if it satisfies the following conditions:
    - The temperature is less than 800.
    - The number of neutrons emitted per second is greater than 500.
    - The product of temperature and neutrons emitted per second is less than 500000.

    :param voltage: int
    :param current: int
    :param theoretical_max_power: int
    :return: str one of 'green', 'orange', 'red', or 'black'

    Efficency can be grouped into 4 bands:

    1. green  ->   80-100% efficency
    2. orange ->   60-79% efficency
    3. red    ->   30-59% efficency
    4. black  ->   <30% efficent

    These percentage ranges are calculated as
    (generated power/ theoretical max power)*100
    where generated power = voltage * current
