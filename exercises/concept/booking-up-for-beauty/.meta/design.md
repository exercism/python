# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the basics of `datetime` objects in Python.

## Learning objectives

- Understand ways to create `datetime` objects
- Understand the use of `strptime()` to parse strings into `datetime`
- Understand the use of `strftime()` to format string representations of `datetime` objects
- Understand how to isolate and use components such as `year` or `hour`

## Out of scope

- Anything related to timezones
- Working with `timedelta`

## Concepts covered

- `datetime.date`
- `strptime()`
- `strftime()`

## Prerequisites

## Implementing

The general Python track concept exercise implantation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/languages/python/reference/implementing-a-concept-exercise.md).

Tests should be written using `unittest.TestCase` and the test file named `generators_test.py`.

Code in the `.meta/example.py` file should **only use syntax & concepts introduced in this exercise or one of its prerequisites.**
