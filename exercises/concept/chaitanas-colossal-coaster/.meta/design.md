## Goal

This concept exercise should make the student aware of the existence of some list methods that allow us to work with lists, and how to use them to modify lists and operate with them.

## Learning objectives

- understand when when it is appropriate to use methods of a list to operate with it
- understand that a method of the list mutates the list and do not returns a new altered list
- use one or more of the below methods to alter a list:
- add a single element to the end of a list with the append() method
- remove all items from a list with the clear() method
- insert an element in a list with the insert() method
- remove element at the given index with the pop() method
- remove item from a list with the remove() method
- reverses a list with the reverse() method
- sorts elements of a list with the sort() method
- return a shallow copy of a list with the copy() method
- return count of the element in a list with the count() method
- add iterable elements to the end of a list with the extend() method
- return the index of the element in a list with the index() method
- understand wich data in a list can be sorted and/or compared
