Python provides a number of useful methods that you can use to manipulate
strings. These methods can be used for cleaning, splitting, translating,
or otherwise working with the str type. New strings can be created based
on method arguments, and/or additional information can be returned. Strings
can be concatenated using the `+` operator or with `str.join()`. Strings
also implement all of the common sequence operations along with iteration using
the `for item in <string>` syntax.

`Strings` are immutable (meaning the value does not change), so each of these
methods will actually return a new instance of `str` instead of modifying
the existing one.
