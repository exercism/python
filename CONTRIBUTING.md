## Architecture

Exercism tracks inherit exercise definitions from the [problem-specifications] repository in the form of description files
(from which exercise READMEs are [generated](#GeneratingExerciseREADMEs))


## Implementing an exercise

### Exercise structure

```Bash
exercises/[EXERCISE]/
├── [EXERCISE].py
├── [EXERCISE]_test.py
├── example.py
├── .meta
│   ├── template.j2
│   ├── additional_tests.json
│   └── hints.md
└── README.md
```

Files:

| File | Description | Source |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| [[EXERCISE].py](exercises/two-fer/two_fer.py) | Solution stub  | Manually created by the implementer |
| [[EXERCISE]_test.py](exercises/two-fer/two_fer_test.py) | Exercise test suite | Automatically generated if `.meta/template.j2` is present, otherwise manually created by the implementer |
| [example.py](exercises/two-fer/example.py) | Example solution used to automatically verify the `[EXERCISE]_test.py` suite | Manually created by the implementer |
| [.meta/template.j2](exercises/two-fer/.meta/template.j2) | Test generation template; if present used to automatically generate `[EXERCISE]_test.py` (See [generator documentation](docs/GENERATOR.md)) | Manually created by implementer |
| [.meta/additional_tests.json](exercises/word-count/.meta/additional_tests.json) | Defines additional track-specific test cases; if `.meta/template.j2` is also present these test will be incorporated into the automatically generated `[EXERCISE]_test.py` | Manually created by the implementer |
| [.meta/hints.md](exercises/high-scores/.meta/hints.md) | Contains track-specific hints that are automatically included in the generated `README.md` file | Manually created by the implementer |
| [README.md](exercises/two-fer/README.md) | Exercise README | [Generated by `configlet` tool](#GeneratingExerciseREADMEs) |

### Generating Exercise READMEs

#### Requirements
- A local clone of the [problem-specifications] repository.
- [configlet]: may be obtained either by
  - (**Recommended**) Following installation instructions at the above link
  - Running `bin/fetch-configlet` (`configlet` binary will be downloaded to the repository `bin/`)

#### Generating all READMEs

```
configlet generate <path/to/track> --spec-path path/to/problem/specifications
```

#### Generating a single README

```
configlet generate <path/to/track> --spec-path path/to/problem/specifications --only example-exercise
```

### Implementing tests

If an unimplemented exercise has a `canonical-data.json` file in the [problem-specifications] repository, a generation template must be created. See the [test generator documentation](docs/GENERATOR.md) for more information.

If an unimplemented exercise does not have a `canonical-data.json` file, the test file must be written manually (use existing test files for examples).

### Example solutions

Example solution files serve two purposes:

1. Verification of the tests
2. Example implementation for mentor/student reference

### config.json

[`config.json`](config.json) is used by the website to determine which exercises to load an in what order. It also contains some exercise metadata, such as difficulty, labels, and if the exercise is a core exercise. New entries should be places just before the first exercise that is marked `"deprecated": true`:

```JSON
    {
      "slug": "current-exercise",
      "uuid": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "core": false,
      "unlocked_by": null,
      "difficulty": 1,
      "topics": [
          "strings"
      ]
    },
    <<< HERE
    {
      "slug": "old-exercise",
      "uuid": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "core": false,
      "unlocked_by": null,
      "difficulty": 2,
      "topics": null,
      "deprecated": true
    },
```

Fields

    <td>Hyphenated lowercase exercise name</td>

    <td>uuid</td>
    <td>Generate using <code>configlet uuid</code></td>

    <td>Set to <code>false</code>; core exercises are decided by track maintainers</td>

    <td>unlocked_by</td>
    <td>Slug for the core exercise that unlocks the new one</td>
</tr>

## Implementing Track-specific Exercises

Similar to implementing a canonical exercise that has no `canonical-data.json`, but the exercise README will also need to be written manually. Carefully follow the structure of generated exercise READMEs.


## Pull Request Tips

Before committing:
- Run `configlet fmt` and `configlet lint` before committing if [`config.json`](config.json) has been modified
- Run [flake8] to ensure all Python code conforms to style standards
- Run `test/check-exercises.py [EXERCISE]` to check if your test changes function correctly
- If you modified or created a `hints.md` file, [regenerate the README](#GeneratingExerciseREADMEs)
- If your changes affect multiple exercises, try to break them up into a separate PR for each exercise.
