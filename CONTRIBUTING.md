**`exercism/Python`** is one of many programming language tracks on [exercism(dot)org][exercism-website].  
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Python _exercises_ currently under development or implemented & available for students.

🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Track exercises support Python `3.7` - `3.10.6`.
Exceptions to this support are noted where they occur.  
 🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Track tooling (_test-runner, representer, analyzer, and Continuous Integration_) runs on Python `3.10.6`.

Exercises are grouped into **concept** exercises which teach the [Python syllabus][python-syllabus], and **practice** exercises, which are unlocked by progressing in the syllabus tree &nbsp;🌴 &nbsp;.  
Concept exercises are constrained to a small set of language or syntax features.  
Practice exercises are open-ended, and can be used to practice concepts learned, try out new techniques, and _play_.  
These two exercise groupings can be found in the track [config.json][config-json], and under the `python/exercises` directory.

<br>

## 🐛 **Did you find a bug?**

It is not uncommon to discover typos, confusing directions, or incorrect implementations of certain tests or code examples. Or you might have a great suggestion for a hint to aid students (&nbsp;💙 &nbsp;), see optimizations for exemplar or test code, find missing test cases to add, or want to correct factual and/or logical errors. Or maybe you have a great idea 💡 for an exercise or feature (&nbsp;💙&nbsp;).

_Our track is always a work in progress!_ 🌟🌟  
While contributions are paused, we ask that you [`open a thread in our community forum`](https://forum.exercism.org) to let us know what you have found/suggest.

<br>

## 🚧 **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

**`Our maintainers are not accepting community contributions at this time.`**  
Please read this [community blog post](https://exercism.org/blog/freeing-our-maintainers) for details.

Once the pause ends, we will **happily** consider your PR.

    <summary>General Code Style Summary</summary>
<br>

- _**spaces**_, never `Tabs`
- **4 space** indentation
- **120 character per line limit** (_as opposed to the default limit of 79_)
- Variable, function, and method names should be `lower_case_with_underscores` (_aka "snake case"_)
- Classes should be named in `TitleCase` (_aka "camel case"_)
- **No single letter variable names** outside of a `lambda`. This includes loop variables and comprehensions.
- Refrain from putting `list`, `tuple`, `set`, or `dict` members on their own lines.
  Fit as many data members as can be easily read on one line, before wrapping to a second.
- If a data structure spreads to more than one line and a break (_for clarity_) is needed, prefer breaking after the opening bracket.
- Avoid putting closing brackets on their own lines. Prefer closing a bracket right after the last element.
- Use **`'`** and not **`"`** as the quote character by default.
- Use **`"""`** for docstrings.
- Prefer [implicit line joining][implicit-line-joining] for long strings.
- Prefer enclosing imports in **`()`**, and putting each on their own line when importing multiple methods.
- Two lines between `Classes`, one line between `functions`. Other vertical whitespace as needed to help readability.
- Always use an **`EOL`** to end a file.

 </details>

<details>
    <summary>Test File Style (<em>concept exercises</em>)</summary>
<br>

- [Unittest.TestCase][unittest] syntax, with [PyTest][pytest] as a test runner.
  - We are transitioning to using more PyTest features/syntax, but are leaving `Unittest` syntax in place where possible.
  - Always check with a maintainer before introducing a PyTest feature into your tests.
- Test **Classes** should be titled `<ExerciseSlug>Test`. **e.g.** `class CardGamesTest(unittest.TestCase):`
- Test method names should begin with `test_`. Try to make test case names descriptive but not too long.
- Favor [_parameterizing_][distinguishing-test-iterations] tests that only vary input data. Use [unittest.TestCase.subTest][subtest] for parameterization.
  - An [example from Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna][guidos-gorgeous-lasagna-testfile].
  - A second [example from Card Games][card-games-testfile].
- Avoid excessive line breaks or indentation - particularly in parameterized tests.
  - Excessive breaks & indentation within the `for` loops cause issues when formatting the test code for display on the website.
- Use [`enumerate()`][enumerate] where possible when indexes are needed. See [Card Games][card-games-testfile] for example usage.
- Favor using names like `inputs`, `data`, `input_data`, `test_data`, or `test_case_data` for test inputs.
- Favor using names like `results`, `expected`, `result_data`, `expected_data`, or `expected_results` for test outcomes.
- Favor putting the assert failure message outside of `self.assert()`. Name it `failure_msg`. See [Card Games][card-games-testfile] for example usage.
- Favor `f-strings` for dynamic failure messages. Please make your error messages as relevant and human-readable as possible.
- We relate test cases to **task number** via a custom [PyTest Marker][pytestmark].
  - These take the form of `@pytest.mark.task(taskno=<task-number-here>)`. See [Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna][guidos-gorgeous-lasagna-testfile] for an example.
- We prefer **test data files** when test inputs/ouputs are verbose.
  - These should be named with `_data` or `_test_data` at the end of the filename, and saved alongside the test case file.
  - See the [Cater-Waiter][cater-waiter] exercise directory for an example of this setup.
  - **Test data files** need to be added under an `editor` key within [`config.json "files"`][exercise-config-json].
  - Check with a maintainer if you have questions or issues, or need help with an exercise `config.json`.
- For new test files going forward, omit `if __name__ == "__main__": unittest.main()`.
- Lint with both `flake8` and `pylint`.
  - Both linters are known to toss false-positives for some testing patterns.
  - Where necessary, deploy the [`#noqa`][flake8-noqa] or [`#pylint disable=<check-name>`][pylint-disable-check] comments to suppress false-positive warnings. - See **line 16** of [Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna][guidos-gorgeous-lasagna-testfile] test file for an example of an override.

If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to ask the maintainers -- they're always happy to help&nbsp;💛&nbsp;💙&nbsp;

Some of our code is old and does not (yet) conform to all these standards.  
_We know it, and trust us, we are working on fixing it._ But if you see &nbsp;👀&nbsp; something, &nbsp;👄&nbsp; say something. It'll motivate us to fix it! 🌈

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Language Versions</h2></p>

<br>

This track officially supports Python `3.7 - 3.10.6` for students completing exercises.  
The track `test runner`, `analyzer`, and `representer` run in docker on `python:3.10.6-slim`.

Although the majority of test cases are written using `unittest.TestCase`,

- All exercises should be written for compatibility with Python `3.7` - `3.10.6`.
- Version backward _incompatibility_ (_e.g_ an exercise using features introduced in `3.8`, `3.9`, or `3.10`) should be clearly noted in any exercise hints, links, introductions or other notes.

- Here is an example of how the Python documentation handles [version-tagged &nbsp;🏷&nbsp;][version-tagged-language-features] feature introduction.

- _Most_ exercises will work with Python `3.6+`, and _many_ are compatible with Python `2.7+`. Please do not change existing exercises to add new language features without consulting with a maintainer first. We &nbsp;💛&nbsp;💙&nbsp; modern Python, but we _also_ want to avoid student confusion when it comes to which Python versions support brand-new features.

* All test suites and example solutions must work in all Python versions that we currently support. When in doubt about a feature, please check with maintainers.

<br>

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>A Little More on Exercises</h2></p>

<br>

- Each exercise must be self-contained. Please do not use or reference files that reside outside the given exercise directory. "Outside" files will not be included if a student fetches the exercise via the CLI.

- Each exercise/problem should include a complete test suite, an example/exemplar solution, and a stub file ready for student implementation.

- For specifications, refer to [Concept Exercise Anatomy][concept-exercise-anatomy], or [Practice Exercise Anatomy][practice-exercise-anatomy] depending on which type of exercise you are contributing to.

- **Practice exercise**, descriptions and instructions come from a centralized, cross-track [problem specifications][problem-specifications] repository.

  - Any updates or changes need to be proposed/approved in `problem-specifications` first.
  - If Python-specific changes become necessary, they need to be appended to the canonical instructions by creating a `instructions.append.md` file in this (`exercism/Python`) repository.

- Practice Exercise **Test Suits** for many practice exercises are similarly [auto-generated](#auto-generated-files) from data in [problem specifications][problem-specifications].

  - Any changes to them need to be proposed/discussed in the `problem-specifications` repository and approved by **3 track maintainers**, since changes could potentially affect many (_or all_) exercism language tracks.
  - If Python-specific test changes become necessary, they can be appended to the exercise `tests.toml` file.
  - 📛&nbsp;[ **Please file an issue**][open-an-issue]&nbsp;📛 &nbsp;and check with maintainers before adding any Python-specific tests.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>External Libraries and Dependencies</h2></p>

<br>

Our tooling (_runners, analyzers and representers_) runs in isolated containers within the exercism website. Because of this, **exercises cannot rely on third-party or external libraries.** Any library needed for an exercise or exercise tests must be incorporated as part of the tooling build, and noted for students who are using the CLI to solve problems locally.

If your exercise depends on a third-party library (_aka not part of standard Python_), please consult with maintainers about it. We may or may not be able to accommodate the package.

<br>
<img id="auto-generated-files" align="left" width="95" height="90" src="https://github.com/exercism/website-icons/blob/main/exercises/forth.svg">
<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Auto-Generated Test Files and Test Templates</h2></p>

<br>

[**Practice exercises**][practice-exercise-files] inherit their definitions from the [problem-specifications][problem-specifications] repository in the form of _description files_. Exercise introductions, instructions and (_in the case of **many**, but not **all**_) test files are then machine-generated for each language track.

Changes to practice exercise _specifications_ should be raised/PR'd in [problem-specifications][problem-specifications] and approved by **3 track maintainers**. After an exercise change has gone through that process, related documents and tests for the Python track will need to be [re-generated](#generating-practice-exercise-documents) via [configlet][configlet]. Configlet is also used as part of the track CI, essential track and exercise linting, and other verification tasks.

If a practice exercise has an auto-generated `<exercise_slug>_test.py` file, there will be a `.meta/template.j2` and a `.meta/tests.toml` file in the exercise directory. If an exercise implements Python track-specific tests, there may be a `.meta/additional_tests.json` to define them. These `additional_tests.json` files will automatically be included in test generation.

_Exercise Structure with Auto-Generated Test Files_

```Bash
[<exercise-slug>/
├── .docs
│   └── instructions.md
├── .meta
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── example.py
│   ├── template.j2
│   └── tests.toml
├── <exercise_slug>.py #stub file
└── <exercise_slug_test.py #test file
```

<br>

Practice exercise `<exercise_slug>_test.py` files are generated/regenerated via the [Python Track Test Generator][python-track-test-generator].  
Please reach out to a maintainer if you need any help with the process.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Implementing Practice Exercise Tests</h2></p>
<br>

If an unimplemented exercise has a `canonical-data.json` file in the [problem-specifications] repository, a generation template must be created. See the Python track [test generator documentation][python-track-test-generator] for more information.

If an unimplemented exercise does not have a `canonical-data.json` file, the test file must be written manually.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Implementing Practice Exercise Example Solutions</h2></p>
<br>

**Example solution files serve two purposes only:**

1. Verification of the tests
2. Example implementation for mentor/student reference

Unlike `concept` exercise, practice exercise `example.py` files are **NOT** intended as as a "best practice" or "standard".  
They are provided as proof that there is an acceptable and testable answer to the practice exercise.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Implementing Track-specific Practice Exercises</h2></p>
<br>

Implementing Track-specific Practice Exercises is similar to implementing a `canonical` exercise that has no `canonical-data.json`. But in addition to the tests, the exercise documents (_instructions, etc._) will also need to be written manually. Carefully follow the structure of generated exercise documents and the [exercism practice exercise specification][practice-exercises].
